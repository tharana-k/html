    <p>A plotter is a specialized output device used to create high-quality, large-format, and precise graphical or technical drawings, often in fields such as engineering, architecture, cartography, and design. Unlike regular printers that use raster-based printing, which involves dots, plotter devices use vector-based printing, which involves lines, to produce detailed and accurate drawings. </p>
